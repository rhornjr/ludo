# ðŸŽ² Ludo Game

A multiplayer Ludo game built with React, TypeScript, and Node.js using Socket.IO for real-time communication.

## Features

- ðŸŽ® Real-time multiplayer gameplay
- ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful, modern UI with colorful design
- ðŸ”„ Live game state synchronization
- ðŸ‘¥ Player lobby system
- ðŸ“± Responsive design

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Socket.IO Client
- CSS3 with modern styling

### Backend
- Node.js with TypeScript
- Express.js
- Socket.IO
- UUID for game ID generation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ludo
```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Alternative: Run Both Simultaneously

From the root directory:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 3000) simultaneously.

## How to Play

1. **Create a Game**: Click "Create Game" to start a new game. You'll receive a unique Game ID.

2. **Join a Game**: Share the Game ID with other players. They can join by entering the Game ID and their name.

3. **Start Playing**: Once 4 players have joined, the game will automatically start.

4. **Game Rules**: 
   - Each player has 4 pawns
   - Roll a 6 to move a pawn out of the starting area
   - Move pawns around the board to reach the center
   - First player to get all 4 pawns to the center wins

## Development

### Backend Development
- The backend runs on port 3001
- Uses TypeScript with strict type checking
- Socket.IO handles real-time communication
- Game state is managed in memory (not persistent)

### Frontend Development
- The frontend runs on port 3000
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Modern CSS with flexbox and grid layouts
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
